# Preamble

This is a Growl notification style meant to look like Coda's tooltips. The intention is to be closer in appearance (fonts notwithstanding) to the tooltip than Growl's built-in *Pseudo-Coda* style.

* Growl can be found at [http://www.growl.info](http://www.growl.info)
* Coda can be found at [http://www.panic.com/coda](http://www.panic.com/coda)

# Installation

1. Install Growl if you haven't already.
2. Download ATOM-Coda.
    * If you download the source from github, rename the resulting directory to `ATOM-Coda.growlStyle` instead of the gibberish github automatically tacks on at the end.
    * If you download the pre-packaged zip, simply unzip it if your browser doesn't already unzip it for you.
3. Open the resulting `ATOM-Coda.growlStyle` file. You will be prompted to install the style into Growl or overwrite the existing one if you already have it. If you're updating it or installing new, by all means choose yes.

# Usage

Basically, use the style for any notifications you want to look like Coda's speech bubble tooltips.

# Disclaimer

Coda is a web development IDE by [Panic Software](http://www.panic.com) which I enjoy using very much at work; it is commercial software and I highly recommend it to anyone doing professional (or even "amateur") web development on Mac OS X. Growl is a free, open-source notification system for Mac OS X by [Growl Team](http://www.growl.info).
